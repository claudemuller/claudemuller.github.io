                Self-made Generalized Specialist polyglot who has worked with
                various programming languages and leans towards low-level
                programming. Webapps, websites, APIs, Arduino projects and video
                games are just some of the projects he’s worked on. Enjoys
                contemplating problems and the way things work, how to fix or
                improve upon them, then takes great pleasure in building a
                creative and robust solution. Loves to constantly learn and
                acquire any skill needed through dedication and
                self-application.

                      dxt.rs is my own brand for my freelancing and game
                      development adventures. I have worked with several
                      companies remotely providing a wide range of services with
                      the varied skills that I've picked up over the years while
                      also endeavouring to create lean video games from scratch.

                    <p>
                      I worked with a company that had created a wireless (with
                      RFID) payment solution for events. The tech included a
                      receiver at pay-points that is connected to a back-end
                      online system that matches up transactions with registered
                      users via the scanning of their tags. I worked on
                      extending their Meteor back- end app as well as built some
                      functions for their React-Native app.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I freelanced for an agency by fixing defects for a hybrid
                      mobile game built in Ionic for Allan Gray, one of the
                      major banks in South Africa. The game had been distributed
                      to many schools to teach students the value of healthy
                      financial practises.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I made additions to the Orlando Pirates' (a local soccer
                      team) Shopify webshop through a digital agency. One such
                      challenging addition was a feature that allowed the user
                      to customise a soccer jersey with their own number and
                      name before ordering. As soccer is very popular in South
                      Africa, this website saw a lot of traffic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I was contracted to do bug fixing on an Ionic app and
                      build a prototype in Angular for a large Crossfit CRM
                      system that sees many users a day from Crossfit gyms all
                      over South Africa and has started to get international
                      attention.

                    <p>
                      In my spare time I build video games and to date have
                      built a Galaga-like top-down shooter in Java with no
                      external dependencies, a few small prototypes in C and
                      JavaScript and am currently writing a game engine in C++
                      and SDL that integrates Lua as its scripting language.

                    <p>
                      I joined a Swiss company stationed in Bucharest on a one
                      and a half year contract as a full stack developer. Team
                      Extension hires and contracts developers, designers,
                      strategists, project managers etc. to assist clients in
                      building any web or mobile system they need.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I built the front-end half of a referral campaign
                      management system in WordPress for a popular pay-as-you-go
                      power company in Ireland. This website interfaced with a
                      C# API written by a colleague. The system was expected to
                      see large traffic during their campaign.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The biggest and longest project/s that I was a part of was
                      for an energy efficient IoT supplier and installer based
                      in USA. The first project I was the sole developer for the
                      most part and we built a customised website in PyroCMS.
                      The main project however was for a CRM type system that we
                      built in Laravel and jQuery. We made many custom lean
                      components and services to accomplish the tasks we
                      required without burdening the system with too heavy
                      dependencies.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We used GitHub for source control and integrated with
                      CircleCI for merges and automatic deployment to Ubuntu
                      servers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We worked in an Agile environment utilising Kanban with
                      Jira and a handful of smaller webapps for tracking and
                      billing.

                    <p>
                      I learned a lot about personal responsibility and working
                      remotely as well as learning about and adapting to
                      different cultures as I worked with North American,
                      Indian, Romanian, Turkish, Irish, Italian, German and
                      Swiss folks.

                  <div class="story-mode-item">
                    <p>
                      Initially I rebuilt Crayon's MVP recruitment platform
                      which was a WordPress back-end and Laravel front-end into
                      a Laravel only solution. The original developers used
                      WordPress as a management back-end and Laravel to access
                      the WordPress tables with a package.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I wrote migration scripts to convert the old WordPress
                      MySQL data to a less complicated version accessed directly
                      by Laravel. I built an admin portal for the management of
                      profiles, leads, communications and prospect/employer
                      matches by way of an relatively complex algorithm.
                    </p>

                    I extended the system to include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        webcam integration for video clips from prospects to
                        employers;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        extensive logging and notifications by way of event
                        listeners;
                      </li>
                      <li>integration with a payment gateway;</li>
                      <li>
                        a system to capture and process CVs and profiles for
                        prospects as well as admins;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        a rewards and credit/coin system for use by employers;
                      </li>
                      <li>integration with Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      I moved the whole system over to a CentOS VPS eventually
                      which I managed myself and wrote management scripts in
                      Bash.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Source control was carried out with Git initially on
                      BitBucket and later moved to GitHub and project management
                      was done in Asana utilising Kanban with a relaxed Agile
                      approach.

                    <p>
                      In 2016 I was presented with the opportunity to move to
                      the coast and work for Derivco - the development house for
                      the biggest online games company in the world -
                      Microgaming. Well they and Playtech swap spots for first
                      and second every few years.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I joined the bingo team of nine talented front-end
                      developers as a JavaScript/TypeScript developer. The
                      online bingo game we worked on was first created for
                      Flash, then ported to AngularJS with the death of Flash
                      and I joined shortly after the port from AngularJS to
                      Angular.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Here I learned in-depth about design patterns and correct
                      software architecture design. I discovered that I had been
                      solving many problems with design patterns all along but
                      never had a label for them. We were expected to write
                      documentation for all the features we developed. We
                      rigorously unit and integration tested our software with
                      Jasmine and had a highly modified version of webpack that
                      we used to build and transpile the game code bundle.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Source control was done with Git and SVN (for deployments
                      packages) and deployment was handed off to TFS and Octopus
                      Deploy.
                    </p>

                    Some of the more interesting tech that we used included:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        communicating with the C# back-end using Google Protocol
                        Buffers;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        a custom "shadow-DOM" we built from Angular components
                        that rendered to an adapter (so that we could swap our
                        the renderer if the need arose) to PixiJS in order to
                        render the game in WebGL or Canvas depending on the
                        user's hardware;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        the integration of the XMPP JavaScript library Candy
                        Chat;
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      We spent many hours hunting for orphaned nodes and
                      observables and various other gotchas and improvements in
                      order to keep memory and CPU usage as low as possible. In
                      the end it wasn't possible to match performance in the
                      version of Edge at the time as we discovered that it had a
                      very low memory limit in place for intensive websites.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I spent time in support where I picked up enough C# and
                      used my SQL knowledge to adapt to MS SQL in order to debug
                      and fix defects across the back as well as front-end that
                      were brought up by clients and suppliers. I also fixed
                      defects in the still-in-use AngularJS platform.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We worked in an Agile environment and utilised Kanban for
                      our team which was managed by TFS. In the support team we
                      utilised SCRUM.

                      Some of the most intelligent and highly gifted programmers
                      I've ever come across work at Derivco with the general
                      rule seemed to be the more gifted you are the more unkempt
                      your appearance and the more eccentric you are - there
                      were many long-haired bare-footed hacker-hippies roaming
                      the halls.

                      Having met creative and forward thinking individuals at
                      Flint, a digital strategist and UI/UX designer and I
                      created our own digital agency-cum-tech incubation

                      As the CTO and indeed only developer I was in charge of

                      as well as the ideas we thought could grow into massive

                      Unfortunately we weren't able to complete and release any
                      of our own tech as running a business with large immediate
                      expenses overwhelmed us and we ended up focussing on
                      client work.

                    <p>
                      I developed a front-end for a debt-collecting/lending
                      company in AngularJS which would have seen large amounts
                      of clients but due to some internal politics the client
                      failed to complete the back-end.

                    <p>
                      A university student had come up with an idea for a mobile
                      app that allowed one to rapidly capture an acquaintance's
                      information and be provided with analytics about how and
                      when they met as well as how they fit into their current
                      network. I built the back-end in Node.js with a MongoDB
                      database as well as a hybrid app in PhoneGap which we
                      eventually published to Android and iOS.

                    <p>
                      I built a notification/announcement system for the new
                      library built in the South African Department of Industry
                      and Trade's Johannesburg offices. I built a desktop server
                      with Black Magic capture cards running on Ubuntu Linux
                      with a custom application written in PHP that delivered
                      media to the 10 odd televisions in the library.

                      For some additional business, my colleague designed and I
                      developed custom WordPress themes for ThemeForest.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      We were selected by Microsoft to join their BizSpark tech
                      incubation programme and were mentored by leaders in their
                      respective fields while also receiving startup resources
                      from Microsoft. We also took on a home schooled intern who
                      I mentored while he skilled up to become a software
                      developer.

                    <p>
                      My biggest idea and the one I wanted very badly to build
                      was an augmented workspace. The idea was that you would
                      sit at your desk with your computer in front of you, but
                      by way a pair of glasses or headgear of some sort have
                      virtual storage spaces and pin/white boards "physically"
                      around you effectively doubling your workspace. At the
                      time there was nothing like this and because of the need
                      to research and develop the complex hardware, it seemed
                      out of reach for a small startup. Now obviously this is a
                      reality.

                      Develop systems and integrations using PHP (Laravel,

                    <li>
                      Develop custom themes and websites using PHP and

                    <p>
                      Wanting experience at a company that worked on many varied
                      projects often, I joined a digital agency called Flint
                      Studio.
                    </p>

                    Here I learned a lot about custom WordPress theme and plugin
                    development and worked with designers to bring clients'
                    requirements to fruition. Some of these included custom
                    written:
                    <ul>
                      <li>calendar plugins;</li>
                      <li>lead management plugins;</li>
                      <li>
                        business branch info plugin that integrated with Google
                        Maps;
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      We worked with big names such as BullenLowe SA, Tiger
                      Brands, Iliadin and Nandos. We assisted on and led their
                      own as well as their clients' digital projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I also learned CakePHP - the framework Flint relied on to
                      build "heavy-lifting" webapps. One such app that I worked
                      on was a financial and investment information portal for
                      companies based in Africa.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I mentored two junior developers and to this day am still
                      in contact with both - one still seeking mentoring from
                      time to time and the other has surpassed me in
                      specialising in PHP.

                    <p>
                      My most enjoyable project was building a Space Invaders
                      clone for Iliadin. I chose Cocos2D and JavaScript to
                      create the pixel art themed mini-game.

                      Rewrote internal and client-facing web systems from Perl

                    <li>
                      Built mobile app for Android (native), iOS (native) and

                  <div class="story-mode-item">
                    <p>
                      When I joined Satinsky I was tasked with the mammoth task
                      of choosing a PHP framework with which to rewrite their
                      Perl client-facing and internal call centre systems and
                      explaining to the CTO why I thought it would be the best
                      for the job. I chose CodeIgniter and explained that even
                      though I liked the look of Laravel, it was very new and
                      may not be mature enough; further, from my research
                      CodeIgniter was the fastest at the time and would suit
                      them the best as their business processes, which worked
                      with millions of Rands and tens of thousands of clients,
                      could not be bogged down by slow systems and tools.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I learned CodeIgniter in a week and using it, Bootstrap,
                      jQuery and MySQL rewrote their systems. This client-facing
                      system allowed clients to log in, view their profiles,
                      payments status', upload the required photos of their cars
                      monthly, download documents from and communicate with
                      admins.
                    </p>

                    I built onto the systems by adding:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        smaller promotional campaign "once-off" applications
                        which saw tens of thousands of leads;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        a responsive portal for assessment agents to go out into
                        the field and capture vehicles' info and photos;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I started developing a bidding platform for buyers and
                        sellers to come together and buy and sell used vehicles
                        but the project was put on hold;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I built a custom WordPress site for one of their brands;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        I built Python tools for managing email campaigns which
                        sent and managed hundreds of thousands of emails by
                        distributing their load to multiple clients running on
                        Linux servers;
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Later I was tasked with creating a mobile app that would
                      communicate location specific advertisements and offers
                      from local businesses to the user from a central server. I
                      solved this by implementing an algorithm that calculated
                      the user's location within a ring-fenced area and notified
                      them of relevant ads and offers. In order to use the GPS
                      effectively on the two most important platforms, I created
                      and Android app in Java and an iOS app in Objective-C. In
                      order to reach as many users as possible we decided to
                      also include BlackBerry, for which I ported the app over
                      to Cordova.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I mentored a junior developer who was taking the leap from
                      a designer and front-end developer to a full stack
                      developer.

                    <p>
                      In January 2010 I decided to follow my passion for
                      computers and programming and started my own web
                      development/design business. My motto was "Fast, simple,
                      custom code from scratch".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I built websites in PHP and JavaScript from scratch with
                      an emphasis on accomplishing as much as technologically
                      possible with CSS before delegating the task to
                      JavaScript.
                    </p>

                    Among the many sites were:
                    <ul>
                      <li>a custom designed pet kennels site;</li>
                      <li>
                        a media-rich site for a freshwater aquatic service
                        company along with a Magento store with the same
                        theme/design;
                      </li>
                      <li>a debt collector's client-facing system;</li>
                      <li>a telecoms and networking company's website;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Most of these sites had a range of custom PHP scripts such
                      as guest books, emailing capabilities and captcha
                      protection custom written.
